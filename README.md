# Train Schedule App
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data set by the user. 

This app was written using JavaScript, JQuery, MomentJS, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and Firebase.

## Improvements

I wasn't able to spend much time on perfecting this application. For instance, the schedule will "flicker" when a new entry is added. This is a result of somewhat sloppy logic on my part, as I have a setInterval() that will re-fire when something new is submitted. Will fix later!
